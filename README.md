## How The Game Works

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy he will lose one of his three lives, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the second level ,once the player reaches level 10 he won the game.
